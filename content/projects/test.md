Ever since I completed my internship this fall, I've been eager to revamp my portfolio. Looking back at my portfolio from last year, I realized it felt flat and uninspiring. With that in mind, I decided to make a complete switch.

I'm going for a dark theme this time and incorporating more animations. The reason behind this transformation is my growing interest in motion design, and I wanted my portfolio to reflect that.
